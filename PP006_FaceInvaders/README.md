Personal Project 6: Face Invaders

**Description:**  
Face-tracking controller for Space Invaders clone.  
Move your head to move the character.  
Opening your mouth will shoot missiles, but saying "PEW" seems more fun.  
Concepts based on [Space Invaders](https://codeheir.com/2019/03/17/how-to-code-space-invaders-1978-7/) and [Face-Tracking](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/face-api).  

**Notes:**  
Implemented on [p5js](https://p5js.org/).
