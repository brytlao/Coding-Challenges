Personal Project 5: Koi Pond

**Description:**  
Simulation of unbound kinematic chains.  
You can click the screen to feed the fish.  
Inspired by [TeamLab](https://www.teamlab.art/)'s [Dance of Koi and People](https://www.teamlab.art/w/koi_and_people/) exhibit.  
Concepts based on [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/)'s [Coding Challenge 64.2](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/064.2-inverse-kinematics.html).  

**Notes:**  
Kinematic constraints were not strictly implemented.  
Implemented on [p5js](https://p5js.org/).
