Coding Challenge 111: Animated Sprites (p5js)

**Description:**  
Watch the trippy flowers go up.  
A spritesheet is used to achieve animation.  
A depth effect is achieved by rendering images wrt size.  

**Additions:**  
A transparent file is necessary for overlapping images.  
I used an online gif [editor](https://ezgif.com/) for editing.
