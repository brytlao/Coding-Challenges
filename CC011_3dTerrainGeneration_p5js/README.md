Coding Challenge 011: 3D Terrain Generation (p5js)

**Description:**  
Cruise your paper plane through the trenchy terrain.  
The terrain is procedurally generated using a mesh.  
The smoothness is achieved using Perlin noise.  

**Additions:**  
Walls and plane (turbo!) control are added for effect.  
Refactored for web use.
