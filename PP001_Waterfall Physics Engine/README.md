Personal Project 1: Waterfall Physics Engine

**Description:**  
Simple waterfall simulation.  
Use of a 2D physics engine for gravity and object collision.  
Objects are reused once they leave the screen.  

**Notes:**  
Computational cost is too high with increasing number of objects in the World.  
Implemented on [p5js](https://p5js.org/) with the help of [Matter.js](http://brm.io/matter-js/).
