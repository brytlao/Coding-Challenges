# Coding-Challenges
I attempt to take on [Coding Challenges](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/) by Daniel Shiffman.  
My tools are [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [p5js](https://p5js.org/).  
Live demos are hosted on [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/181789/#sketches) and [p5js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/brytlao/sketches).
  
Since July 2019, I've started on some Personal Projects.  
Since they're similar in nature, I've decided to host them in this same space.
