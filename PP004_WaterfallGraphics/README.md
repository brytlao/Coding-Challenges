Personal Project 4: Waterfall Graphics

**Description:**  
Waterfall simulation with patterned output.  
Inspired by Osaka Station's waterfall display.  
Any pattern can be rendered simply by feeding a 2D array.  

**Notes:**  
Simple patterns were used to reduce lag.  
Implemented on [p5js](https://p5js.org/).
