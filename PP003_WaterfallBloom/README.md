Personal Project 3: Waterfall Bloom

**Description:**  
Waterfall simulation with Animated Sprites as obstacles.  
Inspired by [TeamLab](https://www.teamlab.art/)'s [Transcending Boundaries](https://www.teamlab.art/e/pacelondon/) exhibit.  
The ellipses are replaced with images from a spritesheet.  

**Notes:**  
Number of on-screen elements was reduced to reduce lag.  
Implemented on [p5js](https://p5js.org/).
