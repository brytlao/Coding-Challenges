Personal Project 2: Waterfall Minimal Physics

**Description:**  
Waterfall simulation without physics engine.  
Inspired by [TeamLab](https://www.teamlab.art/)'s [Transcending Boundaries](https://www.teamlab.art/e/pacelondon/) exhibit.  
Concept of AABB Collision was used.  

**Notes:**  
Computational cost is fairly low without the physics engine.  
Implemented on [p5js](https://p5js.org/).
